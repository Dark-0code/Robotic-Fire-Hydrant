Overview

The Spider Fire Hydrant Robot is a six-legged autonomous firefighting robot designed to detect and extinguish small fires in hazardous environments. It uses fire sensors, a water spray system, and Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and control. Built with either Arduino or ESP32, the robot combines mobility, intelligence, and precision to improve firefighting response efficiency.

Key Features

Autonomous Navigation: Moves independently to detect fire sources.

Six-Leg Design: Provides superior stability and movement on uneven surfaces.

Fire Detection System: Equipped with flame and temperature sensors for early fire recognition.

Water Spray Mechanism: Automatically activates upon fire detection to extinguish flames.

Wi-Fi Connectivity: Enables remote monitoring and manual override control.

Compact and Durable: Small form factor for use in confined spaces.

Components Used

ESP32 or Arduino Microcontroller

Flame Sensor

Temperature Sensor

Servo Motors (for leg movement)

Water Pump and Spray Nozzle

Wi-Fi Module (if using Arduino)

Power Supply (Battery Pack)

Frame and Mechanical Structure

Working Principle

The robot constantly scans its surroundings using the fire sensor.

When fire or high temperature is detected, it moves toward the source.

The water pump is activated, spraying water until the fire is extinguished.

The robot can operate autonomously or be controlled via Wi-Fi for manual firefighting assistance.

Applications

Firefighting in hazardous or confined areas

Industrial safety monitoring

Early fire detection systems

Research and educational robotics projects

Team Roles

Lead Engineer: Hardware and system integration

Programmer: Firmware and control logic development

Mechanical Designer: Leg mechanism and chassis design

Network Specialist: Wi-Fi setup and remote communication

Safety and Limitations

The robot is designed for small-scale fires only.

Water pressure and movement range should be tested before deployment.

Ensure all electronic parts are insulated from water exposure.

Future Enhancements

Integration of thermal cameras for better fire detection.

Addition of AI-based fire pattern recognition.

Solar-powered or long-duration battery systems.
